可将`Response`实例直接置于条件判断中，转为bool为是否为200ok

源码：

```python
    def __bool__(self):
        """Returns True if :attr:`status_code` is less than 400.

        This attribute checks if the status code of the response is between
        400 and 600 to see if there was a client error or a server error. If
        the status code, is between 200 and 400, this will return True. This
        is **not** a check to see if the response code is ``200 OK``.
        """
        return self.ok
```

但我还是偏向于`raise_for_status()`方法

关于hook触发时机在

```python
    def send(self, request, **kwargs):
        """Send a given PreparedRequest.

        :rtype: requests.Response
        """
		...
        hooks = request.hooks

        # Get the appropriate adapter to use
        adapter = self.get_adapter(url=request.url)

        # Start time (approximately) of the request
        start = preferred_clock()

        # Send the request
        r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)

        # Total elapsed time of the request (approximately)
        elapsed = preferred_clock() - start
        r.elapsed = timedelta(seconds=elapsed)

        # Response manipulation hooks
        r = dispatch_hook("response", hooks, r, **kwargs)

```

的`dispatch_hook`函数内

```python
def dispatch_hook(key, hooks, hook_data, **kwargs):
    """Dispatches a hook dictionary on a given piece of data."""
    hooks = hooks or {}
    hooks = hooks.get(key)
    if hooks:
        if hasattr(hooks, "__call__"):
            hooks = [hooks]
        for hook in hooks:
            _hook_data = hook(hook_data, **kwargs)
            if _hook_data is not None:
                hook_data = _hook_data
    return hook_data
```

并可以给hook附带参数
